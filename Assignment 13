; Write a program that does the following:
; Given an array of 8-byte integers, sort the array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
; Your program should print the array before and after the sort takes place. 
; If you are unable to attend the lecture where the algorithm is presented, 
; you can find it here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/

; It is important that you code this yourself or along with another student instead of copying the implementation
; of the algorithm from the Internet.
